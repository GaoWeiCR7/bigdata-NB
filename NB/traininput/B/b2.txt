I had traveled here to Henson's last home -- now a historic site that Carter formerly directed -- to learn more about a man who was， in many ways， an African-American Moses。 After winning his own freedom from slavery， Henson secretly helped hundreds of other slaves to escape north to Canada -- and liberty。 Many settled here in Dresden with him。
